# Product Catalog

A product has at least the following information:
- **Item**: the overall product info (e.g. Leviâ€™s 501)
- **Variant**: a specific variant of an item (e.g. in black size 6) which typically has a specific SKU / UPC
- **Price**: price information may vary based on the store, the variant, etc
- **Hierarchy**: the item taxonomy
- **Vendors**: a given sku may be available through different vendors if the site is a marketplace
